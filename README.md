# coursera---Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Downloads zip file and extracts files

Set working directory. Script reads each file into a data frame

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Creates a tidy data set (tidy.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
